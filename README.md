# Prototypingapps

This repository contains a collection of interactive prototyping applications built using Python, Streamlit, and various APIs and machine learning models. Each project is designed to explore and demonstrate how LLMs, recommendation systems, data visualization, and productivity tools can be integrated into real-world use cases.

## Features

- Streamlit-based frontend for easy interaction and rapid prototyping
- Integration of LLMs for personalized interaction (OpenAI/Cohere)
- Real-time data integration (weather, news, calendars)
- Clean UI with multiple tabs and interactive components

## Setup

To run any of the apps locally:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
